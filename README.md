After downloading rename the folder "fivem-jumpscare" to "jumpscare", put it into your resources.
Add ```ensure jumpscare``` to your server.cfg  
Into the config.lua under Config.Users add your identifier license for you to be allowed to use this command. 
You can find out your license by looking into your database into users, or using [This resource](https://github.com/namechangezero/fivem-check-license)

```refresh``` and after that
```ensure jumpscare```
