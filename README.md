# Jumpscare script for FiveM  
Usage:  
Download [on the release page](https://github.com/namechangezero/fivem-jumpscare/releases/tag/prerelease_alpha_v1) and clicking under Assets on Source Code (zip).  
Extract the zip (if you don't know how google how to extract a zip lol)  
After downloading rename the folder "fivem-jumpscare" to "jumpscare", put it into your resources.
Add  
```ensure jumpscare``` to your server.cfg  
Into the config.lua under Config.Users add your identifier license for you to be allowed to use this command. 
You can find out your license by looking into your database into users, or using [This resource](https://github.com/namechangezero/fivem-check-license).  
Use  
```/jumpscare playerId jumpscare.mp4```  to jumpscare a player, while changing playerId with the ingame player id of the player to be jumpscared.  
Also you can add your own jumpscare video by putting the mp4 file into the assets folder, and typing these commands into the server console:  
```refresh``` and after that
```ensure jumpscare```  
# ATTENTION:
